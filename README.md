# Supplement Sales Analysis Project üíä

## üìñ Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of weekly supplement sales data. The primary goal is to uncover sales patterns, identify top-performing products and categories, and understand the influence of different platforms and locations on revenue. This analysis can help in making data-driven decisions for marketing, inventory management, and business expansion strategies. üìà

-----

## üíæ Dataset

The analysis is based on the `Supplement_Sales_Weekly_Expanded.csv` dataset. The dataset contains the following columns:

  * **Date**: The date of the sales record (weekly).
  * **Product Name**: The name of the supplement sold.
  * **Category**: The category to which the supplement belongs.
  * **Units Sold**: The number of units sold in that week.
  * **Price**: The price per unit of the supplement.
  * **Revenue**: The total revenue generated from the sales (`Units Sold` \* `Price`).
  * **Discount**: The discount applied to the product.
  * **Units Returned**: The number of units returned.
  * **Location**: The geographical location of the sale (Canada, UK, USA).
  * **Platform**: The platform where the sale was made (Amazon, Walmart, iHerb).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need the following libraries:

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * plotly

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

### Usage

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Make sure you have the `Supplement_Sales_Weekly_Expanded.csv` file in the same directory.
3.  Open the `s_s_analysis.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment to view and run the analysis.

## üìä Analysis and Key Findings

The analysis is performed using Python with pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization. Here's a breakdown of the steps and the key insights:

### 1\. Data Loading and Preparation

The first step is to load the necessary libraries and the dataset. We also perform some initial data cleaning and preparation.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Supplement_Sales_Weekly_Expanded.csv')

# Convert 'Date' column to datetime
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Check for missing values and duplicates
print(f"Missing values: {df.isna().sum().sum()}")
print(f"Duplicate rows: {df.duplicated().sum()}")
```

**Finding**: The dataset is clean with **no missing values or duplicate rows**, which is excellent for analysis.

### 2\. Category Performance and Product Demand

We analyze the revenue generated by each product category to identify which categories are the most popular among customers.

```python
# Group by Category and sum the Revenue
category_revenue = df.groupby('Category')['Revenue'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)

# Plotting the results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
category_revenue.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Product Category Demand by Revenue')
plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.ylabel('Total Revenue')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

**Finding**: The "Protein" and "Vitamin" categories are the highest revenue generators, indicating a strong market demand for these products.

### 3\. Sales Performance by Location and Platform

This analysis helps understand which platforms are most effective in different locations.

```python
# Group by Location and Platform to get total revenue
loc_platform_revenue = df.groupby(['Location', 'Platform'])['Revenue'].sum().unstack().fillna(0)

# Plotting the results
loc_platform_revenue.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(14, 7))
plt.title('Revenue by Location and Platform')
plt.xlabel('Location')
plt.ylabel('Total Revenue')
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.legend(title='Platform')
plt.show()
```

**Finding**: The revenue is distributed quite evenly across platforms in Canada and the UK. However, in the USA, Amazon and iHerb significantly outperform Walmart in terms of sales revenue.

### 4\. Top Performing Products

We identify the top 10 revenue-generating products to focus marketing efforts and manage inventory.

```python
# Group by Product Name and get total revenue
top_products = df.groupby('Product Name')['Revenue'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)

# Plotting the results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
top_products.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Top 10 Products by Revenue')
plt.xlabel('Product Name')
plt.ylabel('Total Revenue')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

**Finding**: **Whey Protein** is the top-performing product, followed by other popular supplements like Creatine and Vitamin C. This highlights the specific products that are major revenue drivers.

### 5\. Product Return Rate Analysis

Understanding which product categories have high return rates is crucial for quality control and improving customer satisfaction.

```python
# Calculate Return Rate
df['Return Rate'] = df['Units Returned'] / df['Units Sold']

# Group by Category to get the mean return rate
category_return_rate = df.groupby("Category")['Return Rate'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)

# Plotting the results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x=category_return_rate.index, y=category_return_rate.values)
plt.title('Average Return Rate by Category')
plt.ylabel('Average Return Rate')
plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

**Finding**: **Performance** supplements have the highest average return rate. This could suggest issues with product efficacy, side effects, or mismatched customer expectations. Further investigation into the reasons for returns in this category is recommended.
